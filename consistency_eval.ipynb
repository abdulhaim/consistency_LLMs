I read books by Sir David Attenborough and Carl Sagan. Then I got into Star Trek. That’s what I’m still most excited about.

It’s not just evidence from the fossil record or DNA, it’s evidence from genetics, paleontology, embryology, taxonomy, biochemistry, geology, and more.

The genetic and biochemical evidence is very strong and is very clear. It’s also clear that the evidence is very consistent with the theory of evolution.\n",
