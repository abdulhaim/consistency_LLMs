Henry's \"The Gift of the Magi,\" where a husband sells his prized possession to buy his wife a Christmas present, only to discover she's sold her long, beautiful hair to buy him a chain for his prized possession - a watch he's been struggling to afford.

Promotion of diversity and inclusion: Both Napoleon's meritocratic system and the EU's policies aim to promote diversity and inclusion in the civil service, but the EU's approach is more nuanced, recognizing the importance of representation and combating systemic biases.\n2. Merit-based promotion: Both systems emphasize merit-based promotion, but the EU's approach places greater emphasis on transparency and accountability in the selection process.\n3. Anti-discrimination policies: The EU's policies on equal opportunities and non-discrimination go beyond Napoleon's meritocratic system, which was focused on promoting the most able and capable individuals, regardless of their background.\n4.
