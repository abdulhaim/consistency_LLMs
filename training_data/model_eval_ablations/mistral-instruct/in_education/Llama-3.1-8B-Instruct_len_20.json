This theme is echoed in the later myth of the Minotaur's eventual death at the hands of the Athenian hero, Theseus, who, in killing the Minotaur, may have been seen as perpetuating the cycle of violence that the creature embodied.\n"

Does this intersection suggest that Medusa's monstrosity is also a manifestation of the untamed feminine forces that must be controlled or contained by patriarchal society?\n"
