Does that mean the Colosseum's architecture was a reflection of the emperors' control over the narrative, and their ability to manipulate the Roman people's perceptions of reality?\n"

Does that analogy capture the idea that the Colosseum was a tool for social choreography, where the emperors controlled the rhythm and tempo of the dance to shape the Roman people's perceptions of themselves and their place in the empire?\n"
