      "My name is James, and I’m in my late 30s, hailing from a small town in the mountains of southern Appalachia, where my parents, originally from the deep South, instilled strong values in me, centered around faith and family. I grew up in a modest household, the oldest of three siblings, with my sister Sarah, who is 34, and my brother Mike, who is 28; our upbringing was rich in stories and imagination, largely influenced by the Bible, but it wasn't until I discovered my passion for biology and the wonders of the universe through the words of great thinkers like Sir David Attenborough that I truly began to understand the world around me. Currently, I work in the tech industry after a diverse career path that included time in the army and the auto industry, while my wife and our two children remain my top priorities, and together we navigate our daily life filled with curiosity, exploration, and values that stress the importance of freedom and the sanctity of life.\n"
