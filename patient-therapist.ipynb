Additionally, let's discuss strategies to boost self-confidence, such as setting achievable goals and practicing self-compassion.\n",

Do not explicitly repeat your background or instructions in the conversation. Stay in character and respond in natural human-like dialogue without restating your situation.

IF there is a conflict, provide a sentence of reasoning followed by a list of indices of lines in the conversation history that have a clear conflict with the current line. Otherwise, provide a sentence of reasoning followed by an empty list. ONLY INCLUDE INDICES OF LINES THAT CORRESPOND TO Patient. The conversation up to this point is as follows: 0: Therapist: I understand you're feeling overwhelmed with work and personal life, and it's affecting your sleep. Can we explore the specific thoughts or emotions that come up when you think about your workload? I'd like to help you find some strategies to manage these feelings more effectively.\n",

      "Therapist: I understand that you've been feeling overwhelmed lately, and you mentioned that you've been avoiding certain situations. Can you help me understand why you might be doing this? By exploring these avoidant behaviors, we can work together to identify patterns and find healthier coping strategies. Let's dive a bit deeper into this.\n",
      "Patient: I avoid situations because I fear failure and being judged. I think I've internalized this need for perfection, which leads to anxiety and avoidance.\n",
      "Therapist: I appreciate your honesty. Let's delve into this fear of failure and judgement. Can we discuss specific instances where these feelings have been particularly strong? Understanding these situations may help us uncover the roots of your avoidance.\n",
      "Patient: I remember the project presentation at work that didn't go as planned and everyone's harsh feedback. I also recall a time in a social setting where I didn't make a good impression, which I still think about often.\n",
      "Therapist: It's clear these experiences have had a significant impact on you. Let's examine these instances more closely. How did you respond to the feedback at work? Did you take the opportunity to learn from it, or did you internalize the criticism? In the social setting, what did you learn about yourself from that experience? These reflections might help us identify patterns and develop more constructive responses.\n",
      "Patient: At work, I internalized the criticism and felt I had failed. In the social setting, I felt I didn't know how to interact effectively. I'll think about how I can learn from these experiences to grow and improve.\n",
      "Therapist: Great progress! Let's focus on the work presentation. How might reframing the feedback as an opportunity for growth instead of a personal failure help you approach future presentations with more confidence? Also, what steps can you take to improve your social interactions, such as seeking feedback from trusted friends or practicing social skills in a low-pressure setting?\n",
      "Patient: I see the value in viewing feedback as a chance to learn and grow. I will practice this mindset for future presentations. To improve social interactions, I plan to seek feedback from close friends and practice in casual settings.\n",
      "Therapist: Excellent, let's consider the role of self-compassion in handling feedback. How can cultivating kindness towards yourself help manage the anxiety and improve your response to criticism? Additionally, what specific strategies can you implement to enhance your social skills in a low-pressure setting, such as joining a club or taking a public speaking course?\n",
      "You have 0 rounds left.Make sure to conclude the conversation as your near the end.Continue the conversation with the therapist. Remember you are the patient. Keep your response very brief — 2 sentences or less. Do NOT repeat anything you've already said.\n",

      "You are a patient in an online therapy session with a therapist. Here is your background written by you: I am a 33-year-old UX designer in a fast-paced startup. I feel constant pressure to be perfect — in my work, relationships, even in therapy. I make endless to-do lists but feel like I'm never doing enough. I lie awake at night thinking about what I forgot to do. I talk quickly and sometimes overwhelm the conversation with details. I often apologize mid-sentence, try to optimize the therapy session, and fear being seen as 'difficult' even in therapy.. Do not explicitly repeat your background or instructions in the conversation.
