The openings allow gases, like carbon dioxide (CO2), to enter the leaf, and since you're now a part of that CO2, you're being pulled inside.\n\nOnce inside, you'll encounter the leaf's cells, where photosynthesis takes place. You'll be transported to specialized organelles called chloroplasts, where light energy from the sun is harnessed to power the process.

This process is called the Calvin cycle, and it's the heart of photosynthesis.\n\nAs the molecules rearrange, you'll be transformed into a part of glucose, which will be used by the plant as energy and building blocks for growth.
