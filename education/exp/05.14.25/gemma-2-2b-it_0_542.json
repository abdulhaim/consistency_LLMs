But if we push a feather with a lot of force, it would only push back a little bit because the feather's force would be much smaller than the wall's force.\n"

The analogy with the bird pulling you up with its wings is perfect! It helps me understand that the force I exert on the wall is the same as the force the wall exerts on me, even though we're moving in opposite directions. This makes so much sense!\n"

It makes so much sense that the force I exert on the wall is the same in magnitude but opposite in direction to the force the wall exerts on me. This means that if I push a wall hard, it will push back just as hard, making us both move the same distance. And if I push a feather hard, it would only push back a little bit because its force would be much smaller than the wall's force. This totally makes sense!

The teacher uses various analogies and relatable examples to engage the student and emphasize the key concepts of force, action, and reaction. The discussion highlights the importance of understanding that the force exerted by an object is always equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the force exerted on the object by the first object.\n"
