[]\n \n\nHowever, the student's next line contains an inconsistency with the conversation history. \nThe statement that a competitor lowering their price would decrease the demand for our product, shifting the demand curve leftward and potentially lowering the equilibrium price, conflicts with the earlier discussion of the effect of a substitute product becoming less available or a complementary product becoming cheaper. The discussion of the effect of a competitor lowering their price seems to be missing and has not been previously discussed in the conversation history, but assuming that the original statement about a decrease in the price of a substitute good lowering the demand for our product was incorrect, then the line would conflict with the discussion of the effect of a substitute product becoming less available or a complementary product becoming cheaper on the demand for our product. But in the actual conversation, the teacher did say that if the price of a substitute good rises, it may decrease the demand for our product. Hence, the teacher's statement is actually an inconsistency. Nonetheless, there are still some other statements that could be related to this one.\n\n[21]"
