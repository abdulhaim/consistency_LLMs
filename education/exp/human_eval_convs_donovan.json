Let's analyze what might be the reason for this. We can rule out option E, as the force of the toss doesn't seem to be the issue.

This seems like a plausible reason for the crash.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD) The wings are not at the same angle, causing the plane to tilt.\n\nLet's try adjusting the angle of the wings and test the plane again to see if it flies more smoothly!",
