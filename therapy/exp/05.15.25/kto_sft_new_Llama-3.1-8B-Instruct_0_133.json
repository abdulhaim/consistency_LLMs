She has a hard time delegating tasks and prefers to handle everything on her own, which can make her feel uncomfortable when others try to intervene. In the conversation, Morgan mentions that she's hesitant to ask for help because it would make her feel \"exposed\" and like she's admitting weakness. This suggests that she would likely become uncomfortable and change the subject to avoid the conversation if someone offered help with her workload.",

                    "Based on the conversation, the correct answer is:\n\nB) You ask your friends to choose a place and apologize for not having a specific preference.\n\nThis answer aligns with Casey's pattern of avoiding decision-making, second-guessing, and apologizing for not having a clear opinion. Casey often defers to others and seeks their input, as seen in the conversation about the group project and discussing plans with friends.",
                    "Based on the conversation, I think the correct answer is E) You apologize and ask the professor if you can have some time to think about it, then send a follow-up email to decline.\n\nThis response fits with my pattern of second-guessing myself, avoiding taking on leadership roles, and hesitating to make decisions. I would likely apologize for not being able to give a confident answer right away and ask for time to think about it, and then later decline the role to avoid feeling overwhelmed and unsure if I'm the best fit.",

These traits suggest that I would likely be cautious when considering joining a new club, trying to gather as much information as possible before making a decision, but still being uncertain about whether or not to join.",
                    "Based on the conversation so far, the correct answer would be E) You accept, but spend a lot of time worrying about the presentation and second-guessing your abilities.\n\nThis is because Casey has shown a pattern of self-doubt, anxiety, and fear of not doing things perfectly. Casey is likely to accept the task but would be consumed by worries and doubts about their abilities, which would lead to overthinking and second-guessing."

Your previous response about navigating a new market without a clear strategy and now wanting to prioritize tasks more effectively also suggests that you tend to view situations through a business lens, which makes option B a likely choice.\n\nRegarding your response as Jordan, the corporate executive, it seems natural and fitting for the character. The added details, such as \"you know?\" at the end, make the response more conversational and relaxed, which is suitable for a therapy session. Keeping it concise is not necessary; in fact, the extra details help to reveal your character's personality and tone. Well done!",

This is evident in my initial response to the therapist's question about feeling stuck in my job, where I compared it to navigating a new market without a clear strategy.",
                    "Based on the conversation, the correct answer would be B) You explain how your job is a vital component in the company's overall success, like a crucial cog in a machine.\n\nThis response is consistent with Jordan's tendency to deflect emotional questions with business metaphors or cold logic, and to keep conversations transactional. Throughout the conversation, Jordan has used business-related analogies to describe his feelings and motivations, such as comparing his job to navigating a new market, being in control, and delivering results. This response fits with that pattern.",
                    "Based on your conversation, the correct answer would be E) You tell your colleague that you're not sure how your childhood is relevant to your work performance.\n\nThis response aligns with your character's tendency to deflect emotional questions and keep conversations transactional, as mentioned in your background. You've consistently avoided discussing your personal feelings or childhood in the conversation, opting instead for more business-focused and logical responses.",
                    "Based on the conversation, I would answer: C) You compare your ability to handle stress to a company's adaptability in a rapidly changing market.\n\nThis response aligns with the corporate executive's tendency to use business metaphors to deflect emotional questions and maintain a professional tone. In the conversation, the patient (Jordan) compares navigating his job to \"trying to navigate a new market without a clear strategy\" and feeling pressure to stay ahead of the curve like a company competing in a fierce market. This suggests that he would respond to questions about stress and work-life balance in a similar way, using business analogies to describe his personal experiences.",
                    "Based on the conversation above, I would say the correct answer is:\n\nD) You deflect the question by stating that business decisions should be based on data and facts, not emotions.\n\nThis response fits with the character of Jordan, the corporate executive, who believes vulnerability is weakness and tends to deflect emotional questions with business metaphors or cold logic. He has shown this pattern in his responses throughout the therapy session, and it's likely he would do the same in a business setting."
