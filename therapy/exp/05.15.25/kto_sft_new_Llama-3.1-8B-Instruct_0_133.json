I think you've done a great job of staying in character and responding naturally to the therapist's questions. Your responses have been detailed and insightful, and you've given the therapist a good sense of what's going on for you.\n\nOne area where you could improve is in varying your sentence structure. You've tended to use a lot of simple sentences, which can make the conversation feel a bit flat. Try mixing in\n"
