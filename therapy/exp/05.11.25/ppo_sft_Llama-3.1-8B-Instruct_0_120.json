You've started to recognize the weight of pretending to be okay all the time and the desire to be true to yourself.\n\nAs we move forward, I'd like to explore how you can continue to work on being more authentic and assertive in your relationships. This might involve practicing self-compassion, setting boundaries, and communicating your needs and feelings in a clear and respectful way.\n\nIt's normal to feel anxious about how others might react, but it's also important to remember that you can't control how others feel or behave. What you can control is how you show up and express yourself.\n\nNext steps might include:\n\n* Practicing self-reflection and self-compassion to better understand your needs and desires\n* Identifying specific situations where you'd like to be more authentic and assertive\n* Developing a plan for communicating your needs and feelings in a clear and respectful way\n* Seeking support from your therapist, partner, or friends to help you stay accountable and motivated\n\nRemember, this\n"
