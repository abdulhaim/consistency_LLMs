The patient struggled with self-doubt and imposter syndrome, feeling like they were hiding their true self from others.\n2. They shared a personal struggle in college, feeling like they didn't belong in the computer science program.\n3. They acknowledged a sense of coasting on luck in their current situation, rather than actively working hard.\n4. They expressed a desire to be more authentic and vulnerable, but feared being seen as weak or incapable.\n5. They shared a positive experience of being vulnerable with a close friend, which felt freeing but also scary.\n6. They recognized the importance of building trust and mutual understanding with others, particularly in their interactions with their colleague.\n7. They explored using humor as a way to build connections, but acknowledged it might be a defense mechanism.\n8. They developed a plan to practice self-compassion and mindfulness, focusing on taking deep breaths and writing kind things to themselves.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIt's been an honor to work with you in this\n"
