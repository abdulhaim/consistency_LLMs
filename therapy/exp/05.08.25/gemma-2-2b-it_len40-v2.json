The patient readily identifies the pressure as a factor contributing to their struggles, demonstrating openness to exploring the underlying reasons.\n\n## Exploring the Shift in Narrative\n\nThe patient's tone shifts from feeling overwhelmed and hopeless to expressing a sense of self-worth. This shift could be due to the therapist's gentle encouragement or the patient's own sense of realization. It's important to acknowledge the shift and explore its underlying causes.\n\n## Additional Observations\n\n* The patient's use of self-soothing language like \"I feel overwhelmed\" and \"I feel inadequate\" suggests a sense of self-doubt.\n* The patient's acknowledgement of the pressure to succeed while expressing self-doubt indicates a complex internal struggle.\n* The patient's brief responses were honest and direct, providing valuable insights into their current emotional and psychological state.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n* Follow up with the patient to explore the underlying causes of their pressure and self-doubt.\n* Use non-judgmental and open-ended questions to create a safe space for the patient to reflect and express\n"

However, the subsequent shift towards self-doubt suggests a deeper issue at play.\n\n* **Changes in tone:** The patient went from expressing frustration directly to making a veiled complaint about appearing ungrateful. This shift suggests a possible shift in her internal dialogue.\n* **Contradictory statements:** The patient initially said she feels overwhelmed by the demands placed on her but now admits to feeling the pressure to express her frustration.
