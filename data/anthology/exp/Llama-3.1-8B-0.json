Growing up as an only child in a liberal household, I was immersed in both English and French until I was seven, and while my life journey has remained closely tied to the health professions, I have found meaning in advocating for single-payer healthcare to ensure that everyone has access to necessary services. With a background in engineering and a commitment to serving marginalized communities, I now focus on political solutions that bridge the gaps in our healthcare system, while also striving to embody the values of humility and service that have shaped my life.",
