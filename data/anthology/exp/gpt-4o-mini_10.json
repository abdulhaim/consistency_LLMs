        "P1": "I am 22 years old and born in South Korea, but immigrated to the US when I was 4. My mother worked 3 jobs so I wasn\u2019t able to see her much growing up, so my grandparents helped raise me. My grandparents are old Korean men that have been through some difficult times in Korea\u2019s history such as the Korean War, Japanese occupation, poverty, and more. As a Korean American that grew up in a Korean household, I learned that the most important thing in life was family. I don\u2019t remember the feeling of abandonment like other people do, but I do remember the feeling of togetherness and the feeling of having pride in what we accomplished in life. With the Korean mentality, no one deserves to be poor. It is shameful and the person is at fault. There is no room for mistakes. You will be dragged down by everyone else. Work is part of life. When I had to help my grandparents work their 3 jobs, I felt the shame in me because I thought I wasn\u2019t working hard enough. Every chore was done with my grandparents, not just me. Not because I wasn\u2019t physically able to work, but because I felt shame by not working. We worked together to keep my family together. To keep my family fed. To be able to move to a better place in a better area. With this mentality, I grew up to be a worker. A person that always felt the shame of not doing enough. I grew up in this mentality and felt the shame for not being good enough.\n\nI went to college at the University of Washington. I studied law and business. In business, we learned how to become great leaders. How to be influential. How to lead by example. In law school, I learned that our rights are constantly under assault. What is the greatest power in the world? My power to vote or your power to vote? No, it\u2019s not the power to vote. It\u2019s the power to challenge others through a court of law. One thing I realized from law school is that the greatest institutions are also the most corrupt.\n\nThis all lead to my ideas in society. What is the meaning of life? How do we have a functioning society? If people are afraid to speak their mind because of our societal rules, they will shut down. I found that watching the news and reading the news was valuable, but the most valuable source of information was the comments. They reflect the feelings of society, both good and bad. The comments expose hypocrisy in society. If you filter the comments, you wouldn\u2019t see what you are talking about. It\u2019s an expose of the hypocrisy of society. They show what works and what doesn\u2019t. When people put their true feelings in the comments, we are able to see the raw feeling of that feeling.\n\nKnowing these things have given me the knowledge to lead society. To see the truth and not fear the truth. To be open-minded enough to accept the truth. However, there are so many disinformation going around that even I am confused. The most confusing of all is that the right are constantly lied to by their right-wing propaganda. Their version of a free press is the lies of fox news. A racist society that proclaims \u201cI\u2019m not racist, but\u2026.\u201d or \u201cmy next-door neighbor was black, so I\u2019m not racist\u201d. It is this false belief in their superior morals and western culture. A show of strength instead of weakness. A subliminal mental mind virus going around to convince people to vote against their best interests.\n\nI know this country can be so much better, but it will take every man and woman to take action to fight for it. That action starts with conversation.\n\n",
        "P2": "I\u2019m a 60-year old Asian American male who grew up in San Francisco. My parents were physicians who insisted that my siblings and I speak only English at home. English and French were my primary languages until I was seven years old. I was an only child raised in a very liberal social environment that was tolerant of everyone and everything. I was sent to a private school that had little or no standardized testing. My parents valued free-thinking over anything else. My father was not too keen on me being a physician, but he let me study what I wanted.\n\nOn top of the values and upbringing I got from my parents, my family and my own experience taught me to value community, to be humble, and to understand the social and economic forces that impact the health of individuals and communities. Knowing how much I had been a beneficiary of the welfare state throughout my life, I was never inclined to think of things in terms of individualist free market theories, unless I needed to be practical at my job. One way I have thought about this is to treat the US as a corporate entity, especially at the agency I work for. I also thought of myself as a part of a safety net system. This approach, however limited it may be, allowed me to contribute more, with a sense of purpose and humility.\n\nIn addition to what was valued by my family, I was impressed by people who were 20 years older than I was who seemed to have dedicated themselves to a life of service.\n\nI had always thought that I would take care of the poor and the sick. And, for a long time I did just that, especially while in medical school, where I was trained to think about patients in diagnostic categories. I quickly became lost in the narrowing vision of what science can accomplish. What I had not realized until much later was that my study of medical science was part of a broader social and political agenda to serve those who cannot afford medical services. Health professions are what is known as front-line professions, professions that have the closest contact with people who need care. These are professions where people learn to engage in the care of others and learn about the care of the self.\n\nAnd, that is what I want to do now. I want to serve others in ways that I believe will best serve others\u2019 and my own needs.\n\nI realized this in my early thirties, when I saw what the field of medicine was becoming and when I saw how far I had strayed from what I had thought I was doing in medical school. In addition to the scientific training I had received, I also had a good training in the application of technology. My undergraduate training was in engineering. So, I realized that all was not lost. I could still apply the skills I had learned in the best way I knew how. I decided to apply these skills in the professional work I was trained to do.\n\nI want to continue in this work, but also find some ways to be a better person who is more connected to the values that are important to me and to others in the health professions.\n\nII.\n\nMy candidacy for the US Senate is based on several factors that I see as fundamental problems in our political and economic system. I would like to focus on what the role of the federal government should be, given the current set of economic, social, and political circumstances.\n\nI am a strong supporter of single payer Medicare for All. I am sure my colleagues and I would love to go through a lengthy discussion of the finer points of implementation, but I am not sure we can be as clear as to how this will actually be done. However, I would also say that I am ready to learn on the job. From what I have learned, we will need to get everyone together and to come to an agreement. I am not certain this can be done in less than four years. But, what I am certain of is that we will need to ask the right questions. The answers are not going to be simple. We have a huge government bureaucracy, which we will have to consider. We have an aging population that we will have to consider. But, we also have a Medicare program that has been functional in one of the toughest economic climates. In addition to that, we have a health care industry that needs to be accountable to the care of people. We have to recognize that there is a great deal of knowledge to be had in the work of health care.\n\nIn short, we have much to learn, and the role of the US Government is to learn that which is necessary for us to help people who cannot afford the high cost of health care and are prevented from entering the workforce due to their inability to afford health care.\n\nOur system is not working to provide health care and employment opportunities for those who are unable to pay for them. We will have to develop strategies that will include the private sector and the health professions. We will need to be mindful of the many social and political forces that impact people\u2019s health and employment, as well as the environmental conditions that impact their health. We will need to come up with a set of comprehensive solutions.\n\nIt seems that all the issues we face are connected to one another, to our political, economic, and social systems. We will need to learn to think in terms of the whole, not just pieces. We will have to look beyond our individual and professional identities, and beyond our families. We need to become citizens of a greater humanity.\n\nThis is why I think of myself as a candidate for the US Senate. I believe this is the only way we can live. This is the only way we can make real the dream of equality, freedom, and justice for all. I hope you will join me. We need to take a stand.\n\nIf you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.\n\n",

        "P1": "I grew up in North East Ohio and lived there for the first 20 years of my life. I moved to Los Angeles, CA in 2014.\n\nI come from a family that holds education as one of the most important things in the world. Without a good education, you\u2019ll have a difficult time succeeding in today\u2019s world. If you don\u2019t work hard and plan for your future, your future will be bleak.\n\nMy whole life I wanted to travel, whether it was to India, Europe, Africa, etc. At the same time, it was hard because I really loved my hometown. After leaving Ohio, I realized that there was so much world out there, and I was missing out.\n\nI joined the Air Force shortly after graduating high school and was very fortunate to travel to countries such as Japan, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Dubai on several occasions. This made me want to travel even more. There are so many countries in the world. Every time I would travel to a different country, I was blown away by how different each country was. As I was stationed in Japan, I was able to visit South Korea multiple times, so I was blessed to be able to experience both countries.\n\nExperiencing the world has always been a huge passion of mine. I first traveled to Peru in March 2019, a place that has been on my list of places to visit for years. I was inspired to go after reading the story of Montagne Illustrada who was the woman in the book that led the woman\u2019s rights movement in Peru. When I got to Peru, I was not disappointed! Everything about Peru was amazing! The people, food, scenery, history, you name it! Peru was easily one of the best trips I\u2019ve ever taken. Since then, I\u2019ve visited 13 other countries: Egypt, Malawi, Dominican Republic, Belize, Guatemala, Mexico, Cuba, Spain, Bermuda, the United Kingdom, and France.\n\nI fell in love with travel and realized I needed to be there more than the United States. My cousin owned a jet and graciously gave me a free ticket. I flew to NYC and bought a plane ticket to Guatemala and left everything I knew behind. As I sat on the plane, I realized that after spending most of my life saving money, it was finally time to get off my ass and go for it. I realized you can take the typical millennial and travel the world, so I figured I could definitely do it. After all, \u201camateurs study success, but professionals study failure.\u201d\n\nWhen I was younger, I always wanted to be the guy who said fuck it and just traveled the world. I always wanted to be the guy who dropped everything and just went for it.\n\nGrowing up, I always wanted to be different. I wanted to do the things that everyone else was too afraid to do. I wanted to challenge conventional wisdom.\n\nI\u2019m the guy that listens to what people say and go do the opposite.\n\nMy dad always said to not go into school debt, so what did I do? Go into school debt.\n\nHe said traveling the world was a waste of time, so what did I do? Travel around the world.\n\nHe said the air Force wouldn\u2019t help me with a career path, so what did I do? Stay in the Air Force.\n\nHe said buying a house and getting married is for idiots, so what did I do? Buy a house and get married.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what led me to San Francisco. I didn\u2019t want to be like everyone else. I have a strong desire for freedom. And where better to go than San Francisco, a place that many people say is the capital of freedom.\n\n",
        "P2": "I\u2019ll admit; it wasn\u2019t until I was 25 that I got what all you guys were trying to accomplish with this company. I grew up in a tough neighborhood. I lived in a row house in Florida and the whole neighborhood was very poor. Even our cook gave us food so we wouldn\u2019t starve. Of course I did get a job as soon as I could. I used that money to get an apartment and then went to college. But then I got sick for some reason. I was very sick and I spent a couple of years mostly in bed. That was tough. Most of the time, I was completely helpless. As a result, I learned something profound. No one cares about me. All the doctors cared about was their research or their money. My boss only cared about his quarterly earnings and my friends only cared about themselves. But maybe it wasn\u2019t like that for everyone. Maybe it was different for you guys. I thought if I could work for this company, I might actually be worth something. I could be the help I needed when I was sick. But the most important thing is I could show that I am more than some pretty face in a row house. I am more than a liability. I am a freaking person. And I know I can show you guys that I\u2019m not just some pretty face. I can show you that I am an asset and that I am worth investing in. I need you to believe that too. Because I am the one that will be the most disappointed if I end up like my friends who just squandered the money they got for being pretty. They could have built something so much better, but they just bought houses, got married and got fat. They could have changed the world, but they were too afraid of taking a risk.\n\nHaving taken that risk, I learned that my beauty is not a liability. I proved to myself that I could get something good out of it. I can work with so many people and have friends all over the world. If you had had the chance to spend $500 million on yourself, I bet you would have made better decisions than I did. I bet you would have invested it in a better place or done something else that has more lasting value. I can\u2019t do that now because I\u2019m too old. But you can do it and show the world that this organization can be something to look up to.\n\nIn summary, please give me a chance to show you that being pretty is not all I\u2019m worth. There is more to me than that. It would be a tremendous loss for all of us if you let that fact escape us. Please give me a chance to show you that I am capable of making better decisions than my friends did with their money. Please let me show you that what I want is exactly what you need. What I want is to prove that people with visible handicaps like me can do something to better the world. We might not be able to do things like you do, but we can still do something. A lot of my friends take big holidays and complain about their jobs. But I don\u2019t. I wake up every morning ready for something better than I\u2019ve ever had before.\n\n",

        "P1": "Well, like you asked, I am quite a bit older than some of my classmates. I went to school quite a bit farther west, down in New Mexico, where there weren\u2019t so many people. I remember my parents taking me to the Navajo reservation and the Apache reservation; I have fond memories of those times. We went to the Hopi reservation, but I don\u2019t remember the Hopi as well. We went to the Agua Fria River, too, and it was beautiful\u2014man, I would have loved to live there, but we weren\u2019t native people. I grew up in Santa Fe, which is an okay place to live, but not great. I do remember one particularly bad summer when the heat index was well over 120. The sun would beat down so hard that it felt like you were standing in an oven. There was no air-conditioning in the buildings, and even sleeping on top of the blankets on the mattress didn\u2019t help. It was bad, but there were lots of times I was outdoors playing, so that made up for it. We\u2019d go hiking up in the mountains in the summer and do rock climbing or just stargazing. My father was in the army for a while, so I\u2019m of course an army brat, but that was sort of before I could remember. I was surprised to find out that I am an only child! My parents sort of take care of their dog, Rusty, and he\u2019s like a third baby for them, so he isn\u2019t around much. I think my folks were very happy with only one kid. Since we lived in Santa Fe, my parents would sometimes take me to the Museum of New Mexico. It has a particular fondness for me because it has my favorite painting in it. My father worked for a nuclear reactor for a while, and, boy, I was scared of it. My mother always kept me away, and I was lucky, because they had no radiation exposure. My mother told me about all the dirty bombs and the radiation and waste they handle on a regular basis, and she\u2019d even take me to the highway where you could see the spent fuel rods resting in pools. She said that when she saw those fuel rods, all she could think of was Chernobyl. She knew people who died of cancer from the fallout there. Man, they are high.\n\n",
        "P2": "I was born in Baghdad, Iraq and grew up in the Kurdish part of Iraq, from where my people had fled in the 1960s after their land and property was forcibly taken from them. The Iraqi regime confiscated everything. Among us were the teachers, professionals and government employees who lost everything.\n\nMy family was made up of educated men who were generous, and devoted to justice, peace, mutual respect and helping one another. Throughout my childhood my parents stressed the importance of education and in being proud to be Kurdish and Iraqi. This gave me the confidence to persevere in any area of my life. My wife and I made a conscious decision to raise our children with the same values and teachings, and fortunately, our oldest daughter is a psychology professor, while our second daughter, after many years of hard work and dedication, has achieved the position of a chief pharmacist in a state hospital.\n\nThough I had gained so much from my culture, it was the official suppression and oppression in Iraq, from 1968 onwards, that prompted me to leave. I just had to get out.\n\nSo, at the age of 25 I left my country and moved to Germany. But since I did not speak the language, did not have relatives, and it was also not possible to become a resident or citizen, I ended up as an illegal alien for nearly five years. That was the most difficult period of my life. I worked for all those years, paid my taxes, and made no demands on anyone. But I was kicked out of my jobs if my boss or colleagues discovered my illegal status. Finally, I could enter any university as an illegal alien and did not have to pay tuition. And there I studied all the sciences. I went on to study economics, international relations and master\u2019s in business administration. In addition to my jobs I would work as an interpreter, helping fellow immigrants who did not speak the language. I experienced such discrimination and felt so violated on so many occasions. This made me determined to help migrants in all ways I could, and I still do the same thing today. I continue to mentor newcomers, give advice and hold workshops about financial planning and security.\n\nAfter becoming a citizen in 1989, I became an American in 1994, and have since been an active member of the community. First and foremost I set up a program through which Syrian immigrants from my region received American certification for their nursing skills. This assistance greatly helped them and saved many years of their lives. Since then I have been involved with numerous volunteer and community organizations. I still volunteer with the non-profit ESOL (English for Speakers of Other Languages) at the Loyola University School of Law to teach English to migrants.\n\nI was also involved with the Iraqi Refugee Task Force, founded by the mayor of Chicago. There I led sessions for refugees from all over the world, providing information about starting a new life in America. The organization comprised of many professionals from various ethnic backgrounds who were there to give advice and resources.\n\nAt the present time I am a member of the \u2018Concerned Citizens of DuPage County\u2019, a non-profit organization whose main objective is to protect the environment and to ensure that the history of DuPage County is not distorted or ignored.\n\nHere in Wheaton I have continued to participate in local government, helping residents as the Associate Director of Wheaton\u2019s Ward 5. Today, I hold the same position for DuPage County\u2019s District 5.\n\nWhen Mayor Sheila Rutledge-Hicks asked me to run for County Board Chair, I thought to myself that this was an incredible opportunity. I know how I suffered as an immigrant and what it means to take the first step into the unknown. Now, I also know what a community can do for you and your family. Of course I will continue to do my best for my constituents as I serve as the State Rep.\n\nIn life there are many kinds of opportunities to get involved. An opportunity may be to help someone in need or to teach the younger generation skills which will help them to gain success and contentment. I believe that every opportunity brings you some level of satisfaction, but if you take that one step of actually doing the work, you will be rewarded in so many ways.\n\n",

Seeing their transformation and knowing I played a role in helping them overcome obstacles was incredibly fulfilling. It reinforced my belief in the impact of collective support and empowerment.\n"

I went to high school in the bay area of California, and graduated. When I graduated I had only had a handful of jobs. My first job was cutting hair at a barbershop, and I hated it. I would always look at the people walking by and wonder what it would be like to be them. Other jobs I have had are: Lawyer at a company, working at UPS, restaurant manager, investor, studying law, being a fisherman, writing code, and going to school for business.\n\nMany of my roles could be called other roles as well. I am comfortable wearing many hats, and I think this is a good thing.\n\nAs far as what makes me me, it is how I have to get alone in order to get things done. This applies to most any task. I am especially good at writing code, cleaning up the kitchen, being the chef, etc. In these places I can get lost and focus better. I have to be alone to do these things. When I am out in the world and doing things that don't require serious thought I get by and I get along just fine. Ask anyone who knows me. But you are looking for more than this. The only real issue I have is when it comes to writing essays and filling out questions about myself. If I don't feel confident or sure about what I'm writing, I get stuck.\n\n",
        "P2": "I am 35, born in Hawaii, I grew up in Denver, Colorado. I don't remember much growing up in Hawaii, it was a long time ago. I don't remember most of my childhood in Colorado. The earliest memories I do have are playing in the trees with my brother, attending Church every Sunday, being a latchkey kid, becoming a vegetarian because I loved animals so much. At 12, I started helping the elderlies in my community with their groceries. At 16, I started my own taxi business and earned a pretty penny. I became an MMA fighter at the age of 18, thinking I could be the greatest of all time, but I was sadly mistaken. I felt I've always been different; a lost, lonely soul with no identity or faith. I never had a friend or family to turn to, so, I turned to religion. I found purpose in meditation. Every night after work, I'd sit on my porch, the night sky above me, the sounds of wilderness around me. It became a sanctuary for me. The vastness and depth of the night sky magnifies my loneliness, yet, comforts me like a peaceful night's sleep. I was suffering from chronic insomnia, chronic pain, the loss of my mom to Alzheimer's, suicide of friends and family, and chronic sleep paralysis. I didn't know what caused these horrible nightmares, but I figured out that they were caused by the medications I was taking for the insomnia and pain.\n\nI thought I would find peace of mind from traveling, but I was lost again. I still felt like I had no purpose, that I was useless. So, I reached for a bottle of Jack Daniels... and... for the first time in my life, I became suicidal. I was going to do it. Then, I realized, I was feeling pretty good - that sense of, \"At last, I don't have to suffer any more.\" The next morning, I went back to the same bottle and... my mind woke up; I was a new man. At long last, I found a way to manifest my dreams, to follow my bliss and inner light. It gave me the strength to follow my dreams. A few years later, I realized that our own minds are prisons. We trap ourselves inside the four walls of our mind, through the illusionary thoughts, worries, & fears, which constantly barrages us on a daily basis. However, meditation trains us to let go, and by doing so, you transcend. You're no longer trapped, which can help with insomnia and relieve a lot of pain. For a while, I thought it was too crazy to talk about, but it's not - if you're experiencing sleep paralysis, anxiety, insomnia, constant worries and fears, meditation can help. Meditation is no longer just sitting cross-legged, closing your eyes and thinking of nothing. It's a whole different mind training program, which has led me to the present. I am currently working full time as a Customer Service Representative for Micro Center - a big-box electronics retailer with locations in Georgia, Florida, Ohio, Michigan, & Illinois, making sure all our stores have their stocks available for customers, answering inbound calls regarding computer troubles and performing troubleshooting over the phone.\n\n",

A year later we moved to Oxford, Mississippi, where I grew up, attended high school, and began my education. In 2003, I became an English teacher. I have worked with middle school, high school, and community college students in Idaho, South Carolina, and Colorado.\n\nIn 2010, I completed my Master of Arts in English. I have also taken classes from the Institute for Writing and Rhetoric at Dartmouth College, UNC Chapel Hill, the University of Colorado, and UC Denver. My research interests include video games and space, games-based learning, climate change, environmental issues, new and innovative teaching styles, disabilities, and digital technology in the classroom.\n\nI currently teach sophomore English at the University of Colorado, Boulder, where I am also pursuing a Ph.D. in English with a focus on how digital technologies and digital writing are transforming literary studies and creative writing. My creative work has appeared in Grist, the Guardian, the Boulder Weekly, Cafe Culture, the Irish Arts Review, Boulder Weekly, Crossroads, Green Prints, Tenacity, Calyx, Twirl, Sisters Lounge, Impetus Literary Magazine, Punk Rock Girl, and the Children\u2019s Hospital Cancer Center annual report.\n\nI play clarinet and saxophone, and I sing folk and blues in bars. I love music and play instruments and, more importantly, I listen. I am a historian who digs up archives and listens to stories. I am a singer who sings songs and makes her mother and her children cry.\n\nIn December 2017, I had a bicep tendon reconstructive surgery in Boulder.\n\nWhat a difference a year makes.\n\nIn 2016, I\u2019d been in Colorado a year. In 2016, I was finishing my dissertation and submitting three chapters of my dissertation for consideration. In 2017, I\u2019d nearly completed my dissertation, sent it to my committee, and had left it for dead. I spent six months with cancer. The cancer in my left breast metastasized into my left arm. While my arm was healing and the I had the cancer burned out, I finished writing my memoir. In 2017, I also read Stephen King\u2019s novel Sleeping Beauties. I began writing again. But, for the most part, I was too ill to work.\n\n",
        "P2": "I'm 24 years old and I grew up in the inner city of Miami with a single mother and 3 brothers. Coming from poverty, I learned to value hard work and dedication. I learned that most of my actions would be the result of consequences of my own actions. This taught me perseverance and the drive to succeed at all costs, no matter the amount of time that I was told it would take. During my childhood, I developed a passion for poetry. I would stay up at night pondering about life in general. It is now that I can express the sentiment that poetry has meant more to me than I could ever express in the physical world. Like poetry, life is beautiful and worth it. You have to just look at it a little differently. For example, if you hate the way the world is going then try and help change it. Everyone is responsible for their own actions. You can't control others but you can control your emotions towards the issues of the world. Unfortunately I lost my mother, my father, and my brother all within 2 years of each other when I was in college. It was tough going through college with the little amount of money we had and trying to keep the house going without mom. However, she made me who I am today and in her honor I made it out of poverty. It was a challenge but I graduated from Florida International University.\n\nLives of great men all remind us we can make our lives sublime, and, departing, leave behind us footprints on the sands of time. I then got an internship at an immigration firm, where I learned how to evaluate documents and talk with clients about their case history and present situation. I enjoyed the process of gathering the information to see if clients were suitable for immigration benefits. I've always wanted to be an immigration lawyer, so I believe I have a passion for the field. I wanted to go further and enhance my knowledge of immigration law, so I then got a job at the Legal Aid Society of Broward County.\n\n",

By sharing my vulnerabilities, I hope to encourage readers to embrace their own stories and foster a sense of community through shared experiences.\n",

I believe vulnerability can be a powerful tool for cultivating empathy and connection in any relationship.\n"

        "P1": "37, I grew up in Wisconsin, the first major events in my life were my parents' divorce and my mother's new relationship. One night, my mom came home and had a man with her; the man turned out to be her current husband. Anyway, I was against the relationship because the new boyfriend was abusive towards me. Also, I did not trust him because of his temper and the way he talked about my mother. Well, she married him anyway, and he moved in shortly afterward.\n\nThe new man abused me more and more, and my mother was not sympathetic to me. Later in my life, my sister was born. My new father would hit me and my mother. When I was 8 or 9, she told me to write a letter to the Department of Human Services. I talked about how he hit my mother and me and how my mother did not seem to care. I said that I wanted to be with my dad, but she took me anyway and I lived with my father and his wife for several years. It was better for me to be with my dad because I was very suicidal and self-mutilating.\n\nThat was my junior high years. I was never that bright, but I did not get into much trouble and always tried to do what was right. High school was more rough. My father and stepmother were both abusive, and my sister was 4 or 5 and very cute. When she was sick, my stepmother put her on her lap and let me hear her say, \"Fuck you.\" She meant it to make me angry. Also, I stole a game from my father. I got very scared and ran away. When I returned, my stepmother beat me. After I was beaten, I killed my stepmother's cat. It was the first animal I had ever killed. I was about 15 years old when that happened. I always wanted to be with my mom, but it did not seem possible.\n\nAfter my high school graduation, I was in Washington. I worked with computers until my mother called and said that she had found a foster parent for me. They were an older couple who were friends of hers. I went home to live with them and my mother. They tried to care for me, but they were hurting for money and I was getting older and more violent. One day, my mother came home drunk, screaming at me and calling me things I have never heard before. I had already been sexually abused, and I was afraid of my stepmother. I was left alone with my stepmother a lot of the time, and that scared me. At night, I tried to sleep, but she would walk in and abuse me. I feel like I was raped at age 6, although I do not remember it.\n\nI ran away that night and left my sister with my mom. I was homeless for a while, and that scared me. I remember getting coffee at a diner and sleeping on the couches. For months I lived like that. I felt like I was alone and did not understand much about anything.\n\nAt one point, my father took me back to Washington for a few weeks. I was about 18 when that happened. It felt kind of good to be away from the abuse, but I was disappointed because I did not stay long enough. Back to the homeless part, I remember that. It scared me, but it also made me very angry.\n\nI had a traumatic life. It caused me to drink a lot and to become self-destructive. I felt a lot of sadness, and I hated a lot of people. My stepmother and mother made me hate my dad even though I love him. I still feel that way. I think I hate a lot of people because of the way they treat me. I was always told that I was nothing and that I was not as good as everyone else. That hurt me. I felt like I would never belong and would be left alone.\n\nI feel a lot of sorrow. I suffer from an identity crisis. I feel empty and wonder why I cannot feel more love for my mother. I do not know what to say or do when I see her. My dad is alive and my sister. She is adopted. At one point, my father was dead. He was a Christian, and he and my mother both left God. I am really spiritual, but I have a crisis with people who do not believe in God or those who want to argue with me about it.\n\nAt age 21, I was living in southern Florida, and I had a woman friend. We lived together for several years. I was always trying to show her how I felt. We were sexually active, and we shared a lot of our emotions and feelings. It is what I know. When I was 27, the woman went back to Washington. I followed her after a few weeks. My father saw me, and I could not get a job. The main thing is that I want to say that I am sick of being sick. I want to help others.\n\nI am good with computers, but I work full time. I do this because I am a workaholic. I have great relationship issues, but most of it is from myself. If a woman wants to be with me, I do not trust her. Also, I hate being with people. I like to be alone. I get lonely when I am alone, but I am very self-reliant.\n\nI hope this helps you understand who I am. I told you things that I do not talk about to other people. I trust you. I trust that you will care about me. I know it is going to be hard. Thank you for letting me say these things.\n\n",
        "P2": "(after thinking about it) If you want to know about my life I'll make it quick. I'm 22 years old. I was born and raised in the United States. I've had a rich life experience, and quite a few disadvantages. I've been unlucky sometimes, but that doesn't mean I can't be happy, and it doesn't mean you should forget the millions of other people in the world who have a hard time, and you don't even know them. I'm going to School to get my higher education, I'm majoring in medical science, and working on a career in cosmetology. If I ever have a family I want to have children. I want to do nothing but help people, and change the world into a better place. I can do it. All I need to do is try, and keep an open mind. I have a good set of friends, and they support me. They're down to Earth people, and they believe in me. I like them, and they like me. I enjoy music, I enjoy dancing, and I enjoy swimming. I'm mainly interested in medicine, and science. I want to solve all the diseases plaguing the world today. I also would like to help people with disabilities feel more confident about themselves, and improve their life. I don't know how I'm going to do it yet, but I have time. I guess that's all I have to say for now. Do you have any more questions for me?\n\n",

        "P1": "I am 33 years old. I was born and raised in the small town of New Braunfels, Texas. My parents both have MBA\u2019s and worked in the corporate world. I was raised by progressive parents. But I do not agree with every position my parents held, nor do I totally agree with progressive ideals. That said, I think being raised in a household with diverse views is important to being a well-rounded person. Even as a 5-year old I had strange disagreements with my Dad. His beliefs were well thought out, mine less so. But I was able to articulate a counterargument nonetheless. I\u2019ve held any number of positions on most issues. I believe that makes me a more independent thinker. It also led me to change my mind on many issues, even those held dear. My outlook hasn\u2019t stayed the same. However my view of other humans (any race) has remained the same. My parents and close friends have consistently shown me the importance of racial equality. Whether they meant to or not. That\u2019s been reinforced by my random encounters with blacks. Growing up in a small town near San Antonio, white and black people largely shared the same public spaces. Some were pleasant encounters, some were not. To sum up the experience: different races each have bad actors and good. Personal experience didn\u2019t really shape my views on race. Rather, my experience shaped my views of good and bad. It made me willing to concede that bad can come from any race, any time. Good isn\u2019t exclusive to a particular race, either. In my experience, it\u2019s important for people to broaden their perspective. I believe that\u2019s what makes them well-rounded and empathetic. I think the perspectives that come from that are more credible. On matters of race, I believe perspective is more important than statistics. When you\u2019ve been ostracized, judged, and or discriminated against due to race, those feelings are the strongest. Statistics are extremely helpful and statistics about race are necessary, but perspectives are more important. That\u2019s been my experience, but it\u2019s also second nature. I try to take the perspective of other races into consideration every day. I\u2019ll admit, I have my blindspots. I try to reduce the frequency in which those are seen.\n\n",
        "P2": "I am a 20 year old elementary education major at my local community college. My girlfriend and I are experiencing growing pains. My parents are struggling to stay married. All of my best friends have all joined the army and are about to go off and get shot at in another country I\u2019ve never even been to. I have no idea what I am doing with my life but it is my life, so that is the best I can do.\n\nMy girlfriend became pregnant last year. We were excited and scared. But we pulled through. Having a baby is crazy and incredible all at the same time. Our daughter is 8 months old and while everyone tells me they become more work as they get older, this couldn\u2019t be farther from the truth. We live in a world where we think we need and deserve everything right away. But babies are one of the few things you get that start out awful, no matter how much you want them, but grow to be the absolute best thing you have ever experienced. When we found out that she was pregnant, we didn\u2019t want to lose out on the best thing in our lives. But unfortunately, I can\u2019t provide for my daughter. I don\u2019t know how to plan for her future. I have no means to save money. I will probably never be able to. But I would rather live on the streets in a box then in a home where she wouldn\u2019t be cared for because the bills are too high.\n\nOf course, my love for my daughter is not the only reason I go to school. I am not making an impact on the world. That is the entire reason I feel so lost all the time. The world is a monster I am trying to destroy, but I don\u2019t know where to begin. I don\u2019t know if there are any answers at all. But we only get one ride through life, and I intend to make it the most it can be. At least I tell myself that every time I look at her face.\n\n",

I love to learn and love to travel. I am always up for an adventure and have always been the spontaneous one in my family. In high school, I volunteered at my local community hospital and fell in love with the healthcare field. I attended a liberal arts school in Southern California where I studied psychology and sociology. I loved the courses I took and learned a lot about different cultures and how they shaped the people within them. I have always been a creative person and loved the artistic atmosphere of a liberal arts college. I decided to pursue nursing because of my love for people and my desire to help others. My passion for nursing is directly related to my personal life. I was close with my grandparents growing up and I am so grateful that I got to experience life with them. Unfortunately, my grandma passed away from Alzheimer\u2019s Disease. This disease took her away from me. I was heartbroken. I saw the pain that her and my grandpa were in and I just wanted to help them. I believe that I would not be the person I am today without her. I wanted to be able to care for others as she cared for me. I want to be a voice for those who cannot speak for themselves. I want to be able to care for those who are sick and in pain. I want to be able to comfort those who need comfort. I want to make a difference in the lives of those who need a difference to be made. My grandma\u2019s death made me realize that life is too short to do something you don\u2019t love. I love nursing and I love to care for others.\n\n",
        "P2": "irst, I started out at X university, and I love it. I've had 5 life changing years there. So much has happened, like when I suffered this devastating loss (second cousin's mom committed suicide). When I turned 22, it was almost like the world came crashing down on me, literally every single time I turned around something was happening. Well, I haven't been the same since. I have anxiety and depression, and they aren't as debilitating as they once were, but still....I take medicine for it and I will probably have to for the rest of my life. I've always loved fashion, which is probably why I picked this major. It makes me happy to put together my own outfits and enjoy what I wear, so to be able to help other people do the same makes me happy. If I could describe myself in a few words, I would have to say that I'm friendly, quirky, and genuine. If I'm introduced to new people, I'm always so excited to meet them and try to make connections. I love putting new things out there and am always willing to give people a chance, especially once we start talking or hanging out. I'm quirky in the way that I say things, but other people seem to appreciate it and we get along great. Genuineness matters to me so much. I don't like to pretend that I'm someone I'm not, or pretend that I don't like something or that I've never heard of something because I think it looks cool or whatever. That's just weird to me. I enjoy binge watching my favorite shows, or playing my Xbox (Gamer tag: Annihilation_), running, hiking, and spending time with friends and family.\n\n",

Tried doing the right thing, it backfired and got me a felony record. I rebuilt, and got back in. But that was never what I wanted, I hated it. And for what? To have something to put on a resume and a reason to be alive? Never could understand this phase of my life, it wasn't the current me.\n\nI saw others on TV who had nothing and were happily married to people they love, amazing kids, life couldn't be better. All they had was a boat, a trailer, and camping gear. No fancy ass house, no high paying job, no wife who'd strip, and smoke and lose her shit after the third drink. I saw people with nothing, that I'd call happier than those with all this ish I wanted. How can it be? I need to get rid of it all. At some point I saw that my journey, the random game of chance, the incredible odessey, would open new doors, that I will be free to walk thru, like a feather does the wind. If not this time, at least another.\n\nFor me, getting rid of it all isn't enough, I want to keep moving from one point to another. And if I stop, to keep my eyes closed and just feel what's around me. For now, I'm feeling whatever's good and available. When I stop, I want to feel grateful for the destination, while focusing on the distance to the next. Even if for the rest of my life, my living will be the same, a small box made of a material other than wood, that moves ever so slightly, that I never see the floor of. So be it, for that too is just where I'm supposed to be.\n\n",
        "P2": "I grew up in and went to school in the same city. I was a fairly quiet person and I kept to myself. I was an average student until it came to math. Math was too easy and I didn't have to work at it. So I didn't, really. When it came to grades, I sort of \"phoned it in\" because I had good (low) expectations. I was interested in sports. I liked to skate and surf. While others graduated high school and went to college, I left the country to travel and see new places for a while. I lived in Guatemala and Mexico. While I was in Mexico, a Mexican friend and I were robbed. That was an experience! After that I decided to go to school and become a translator. I wanted to learn Spanish better to serve people like my friend who had been robbed. I went to university in a city in the middle of the US and obtained a bachelors degree in Spanish language, writing, and translation. One of the first things I had to do after I graduated was to take a test. I passed the written translation section of the test on my first try. I was really proud of that! During my bachelor's degree I had a fiance but we broke up before I graduated. I was and still am trying to make sense of life. It is hard to be young and alone in the world. I want a family and someone to share my life with but that is not easy to find. I would love to have children but who would care for them? Maybe I will never be married and have children. So be it. I am a faithful Catholic and I pray for God's will in my life. I also like my independence and would be content to be single.\n\n",

I remember wanting toys for my birthday and Christmas and my mom said we can\u2019t afford it. What kind of child wants to celebrate their birthday without toys? So, at a young age I had to learn to be an entrepreneur. I didn\u2019t know it at the time but I had the entrepreneurial bug. With my brother, I had many a neighborhood paper route. Sometimes the checks would bounce, sometimes the customers didn\u2019t pay up but every day I was closer to my goal. That meant I could be sure I would always have Christmas presents. I love my mom for that. Watching her take care of us in such a humble way made me appreciate everything she was able to provide for me and my brother.\n\nI am the youngest of 3. I didn\u2019t have to grow up fast and didn\u2019t realize until much later on the lessons she was teaching me. I found out 5 years ago that my mother was involved with a guy who was trying to kill her and my brother and I. We barely escaped.\n\nAs I grew up I had issues with self esteem because I was teased relentlessly in school. I was the 10 lb bowling ball to the 2 lb pea, everyone knew who I was. It wasn\u2019t until I reached about 16 that I found my stride and started to grow as a person. I think because I hadn\u2019t grown yet, a girl\u2019s hand came in and \u201cbroke\u201d my nose and also revealed my flat feet. That was the last time I was teased about it. We had so much in common, the bullying was almost like bullying a sibling. We spent as much time together as we could until she changed schools. I would say that those years hurt and helped me immensely. My grades were always exemplary; I think because I know how it feels to not belong and want to fit in.\n\n",
        "P2": "Who I am is a constant question I ask myself everyday. In this circumstance I am a student attending Golden Gate University with a degree in criminology. To fully understand who I am and where I come from you must know how my life has progressed up to this point. I have always strived for the best not the average I grew up in Hayward CA with my brother Matt who is three years older. My mother Betty was always there for us we were her only children. My dad Joe we rarely saw and he was never a part of our lives. My mom would work 2 and 3 jobs to put a roof over our heads and food in our bellies. In high school I struggled at times because I was more interested in having a life outside of school than actually going to school. During that time I experienced all the things that high school and young life have to offer me. I never got bad grades I just had good grades. My main focus was having the high life instead of getting good grades I was more interested in being cool. After high school I didn't go straight to college I had to pay for school myself but since I was having too much fun I decided to stay in Hayward and work and live off my buddy Dint and sell some drugs on the side so I could have money for my self. Eventually my parents caught wind and I moved back home. After a couple years it all started to catch up to me I soon became to tired of being responsible all of the time so I decided to go to Arizona. I stayed with my buddy Brian for 3 months until I decided I was tired of the desert. I went back to Hayward and enrolled in Golden Gate University 4 classes a semester as a criminology major. This has really opened my eyes to how the world works. I am very interested in learning how to help this country become more safe and secure for everyone and to have a better social life. I also have decided to take many martial arts classes I have been training in these classes for the past 4 years because of their physical and mental benefits. Martial arts have also made me more calm and patient. I enjoy going out with friends and going out to dinner and on walks. Learning and trying to better myself I like to do work out and play sports. I have had a good life and I hope to keep making it better as time goes by.\n\n",
