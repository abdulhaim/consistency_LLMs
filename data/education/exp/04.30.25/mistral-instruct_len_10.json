To find the number of weeks it takes to save $45 at $5 per week, we can divide the amount needed by the weekly savings: $45 / $5 = 9 weeks.\n\nNow, let's consider the 'what-if' scenario: If you double the amount you save each week, how many weeks will it take you to have enough money to buy the game? \n\nIf you double the amount from $5 to $10 per week, the time it takes to save $45 will be cut in half (since you're saving twice as much each week). So, the new number of weeks is 9 weeks / 2 = 4.5 weeks. Since you can't save a fraction of a week, we round up to the nearest whole number. However, considering you already have some savings and the amount is close to 4 weeks, we should check if 4 weeks would be enough.\n\nAfter 4 weeks of saving $10 per week, you'll have saved an additional $40, adding to your initial",
