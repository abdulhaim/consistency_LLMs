If the clay is too dry, you can add a small amount of water and knead until it reaches the desired consistency.\n\n2. **Creating a flat area**: Begin by rolling out the clay into a flat sheet, using a rolling pin or your hands.

Then, flatten the ball slightly into a rounded shape. Place the rounded shape on the flat surface, and gently press it down to secure it in place.

To make it work, we need to ensure that the electricity flows correctly from the battery, through the wires, and into the light bulb.\n\nNow, let's think about the options. If we connect the wires to the light bulb without touching the battery (A), it won't work. If we touch both wires together before connecting them to the battery and light bulb (C), it will create a short circuit, which isn't safe. Connecting both wires to the positive terminal of the battery (E) is also incorrect. \n\nConnecting one wire to the light bulb and the other wire to the battery, but not both to the light bulb (D) will not allow the circuit to be complete.\n\nLet's try connecting one wire to the positive terminal of the battery and the other wire to the negative terminal (B).

I'd start to use that energy from the sunlight to convert those molecules into glucose, which would give me the energy I need to grow and thrive. And as I do that, I'd feel myself releasing oxygen into the air around me. \n\nThat sounds like a wonderful feeling.

I imagine my chromosomes, which are like long, thread-like structures, starting to replicate, or make copies of themselves. This is called interphase. Now, I feel my replicated chromosomes lining up in the center of the cell, attached to the spindle fibers. This is called metaphase. As the cell starts to divide, I feel my chromosomes moving to opposite ends of the cell, separating into two identical sets. This is called anaphase. \n\nSo, based on my imagination of the process, I would choose C) They're moving to the center of the cell and then separating.",

I'm no longer being swept away by the current, and I start to feel myself settling, sinking downward through the water.\n\nAs I continue to settle, I feel the weight of the water above me, pressing down on me, and I start to come to rest on the lake bed.
