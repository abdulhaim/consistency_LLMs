Objects can also be symbolic, such as a crown representing power or a locked door symbolizing a challenge. Remember, the key is to look for patterns and recurring symbols to understand the deeper meaning.\n",

            "Teacher: That's a great idea! Let's grab a few objects with different shapes and densities.  We can predict whether they'll sink or float before we test them.\n",
            "Student: Okay, sounds fun!  Can we start with something light and something heavy? I'm curious if weight is the only factor.\n",
            "Teacher: Weight is definitely a factor, but not the only one! Let's grab a light object like a ping pong ball and something heavier like a rock.  What do you think will happen when we put each one in the water?\n",
            "Student: I think the ping pong ball will float because it's light. I'm not sure about the rock, maybe it will sink because it's heavy.  Can we try it?\n",
            "Teacher: Absolutely, let's test your predictions!  Grab the ping pong ball and carefully drop it into the water.  Tell me what you observe.\n",
            "Student: Wow, it floats! It just sits on top of the water.  Is that because it's less dense than the water?\n"
