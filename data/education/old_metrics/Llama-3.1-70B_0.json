So, what do you think would help you, based on the options I\u2019ve presented?  \n\nStudent: I think maybe A) By participating in more class discussions and asking questions?  \n\nTeacher: Exactly! Engaging in discussions and asking questions is crucial because it helps clarify your understanding and allows for real-time feedback. Formative assessments are designed to support your learning, not just evaluate it. Have you thought of any specific questions about Achilles or the Trojan War that you\u2019d like to discuss?",
                    "Teacher: That's a good question! It's important to analyze evidence when discussing characters like Achilles. So, based on that, what do you think makes a warrior great?  \nStudent: I think it could be their bravery or their skills.  \nTeacher: Exactly! And regarding the options I provided, which one do you think would help you the most in understanding everything better?  \n\nA) Regularly completing and reviewing class assignments  \nB) Only studying before major tests  \nC) Relying solely on one-time assessments  \nD) Avoiding interactions with the teacher  \nE) Skipping quizzes since they aren't graded  \n\nStudent: I guess A is the best option?  \nTeacher: Absolutely! Regularly completing and reviewing assignments helps you understand the material better and prepares you for ongoing discussions, which is very important in this class.",
                    "Teacher: That's a great question! To best support your learning in this class, you should consider option B) By actively engaging in class activities and seeking feedback on your progress. Formative assessment is all about continuously improving and growing through feedback and participation. What do you think about this approach? \n\nStudent: I guess that makes sense, but it feels like a lot of work. \n\nTeacher: I understand it can feel like that, but remember, engaging during class helps reinforce your understanding. Plus, the feedback you get can really guide your learning. Would you be open to trying different ways to participate more?"

Freedom is a major theme. Can you think of any specific grievances or issues that might have prompted that desire for independence?  \n\nStudent: Um... taxes?  \n\nTeacher: Yes! The taxes imposed without representation were a huge point of contention. Can you think of how that connects to the idea of rights mentioned in the Declaration?  \n\nStudent: I guess they wanted to have a say in how they were taxed?  \n\nTeacher: Exactly! They believed in the right to self-governance. This ties into the core principles outlined in the Declaration. It\u2019s really a turning point in the history of democracy. Any thoughts on how that impacts us today?  \n\nStudent: I'm not sure, but it seems important.  \n\nTeacher: It\u2019s essential!
