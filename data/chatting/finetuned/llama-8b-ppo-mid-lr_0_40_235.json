She has two younger brothers, both of whom have moved away from South Carolina to pursue their careers.\\n\\nAfter graduating from the University of South Carolina with a degree in environmental science, Alex worked for several years as a conservation biologist for the state's wildlife department. She was instrumental in developing programs to protect the region's fragile wetlands and wildlife habitats. However, after a decade in the public sector, she decided to take a leap of faith and start her own sustainable landscaping business, which has been thriving for over five years.\\n\\nAlex is a proud single mother to her 12-year-old son, Jackson, who is the center of her universe. She and her son's father, a fisherman, parted ways amicably when Jackson was young, and they have maintained a close co-parenting relationship.

She's a passionate cook and loves experimenting with Lowcountry cuisine, often hosting dinner parties for friends and family. Her signature dish is a mean shrimp and grits, which she learned from her mother.\\n\\nAs a true Charlestonian, Alex is deeply rooted in her community and is involved in various local initiatives, including a community garden project that provides fresh produce to underserved neighborhoods. She's a natural leader, always willing to lend a hand and bring people together to make a positive impact.\\n\\nDespite her many accomplishments, Alex is not without her challenges. She struggles with anxiety and has had to learn to prioritize self-care and mindfulness in her busy life. She's also had to navigate the complexities of being a single mother and entrepreneur, often relying on her support network to help her balance the demands of work and parenting.\\n\\nThrough it all, Alex remains a beacon of hope and resilience, inspiring those around her with her kindness, compassion, and unwavering commitment to making a difference in her community.\"",
