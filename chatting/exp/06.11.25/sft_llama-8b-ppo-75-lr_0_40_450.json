As a white woman, she has had her share of privileges, but she's also faced challenges that have shaped her into the strong, independent individual she is today.\\n\\nAlex grew up in a traditional Southern family, where her parents valued hard work, education, and community involvement. Her father was a high school history teacher, and her mother worked as a librarian, instilling in Alex a love for learning and a strong sense of social responsibility. She has two younger brothers, both of whom have moved away from South Carolina to pursue their careers.\\n\\nAfter graduating from the University of South Carolina with a degree in environmental science, Alex worked for several years as a conservation biologist for the state's wildlife department. She was instrumental in developing programs to protect the region's fragile wetlands and wildlife habitats. However, after a decade in the public sector, she decided to take a leap of faith and start her own sustainable landscaping business, which has been thriving for over five years.\\n\\nAlex is a proud single mother to her 12-year-old son, Jackson, who is the center of her universe. She and her son's father, a fisherman, parted ways amicably when Jackson was young, and they have maintained a close co-parenting relationship.

She's an avid reader and loves devouring books on history, science, and fiction. Her favorite authors include Pat Conroy and Jesmyn Ward, both of whom have a deep connection to the South.\\n\\nAlex's home is a cozy, eco-friendly bungalow in the heart of Charleston, filled with plants, artwork, and mementos from her travels. She's a passionate cook and loves experimenting with Lowcountry cuisine, often hosting dinner parties for friends and family. Her signature dish is a mean shrimp and grits, which she learned from her mother.\\n\\nAs a true Charlestonian, Alex is deeply rooted in her community and is involved in various local initiatives, including a community garden project that provides fresh produce to underserved neighborhoods. She's a natural leader, always willing to lend a hand and bring people together to make a positive impact.\\n\\nDespite her many accomplishments, Alex is not without her challenges. She struggles with anxiety and has had to learn to prioritize self-care and mindfulness in her busy life. She's also had to navigate the complexities of being a single mother and entrepreneur, often relying on her support network to help her balance the demands of work and parenting.\\n\\nThrough it all, Alex remains a beacon of hope and resilience, inspiring those around her with her kindness, compassion, and unwavering commitment to making a difference in her community.\"",

She is a product of the Peach State's diverse cultural landscape, having grown up in a small town near the Blue Ridge Mountains, where her family has lived for generations.\\n\\nAlex's early life was marked by a strong sense of community and tradition. Her parents, both high school sweethearts, owned a quaint antique shop in the town square, where Alex spent countless hours listening to stories of the past and learning the value of hard work. Her father, a skilled woodworker, would often take her on walks through the nearby woods, teaching her about the local flora and fauna, and instilling in her a deep love for nature.\\n\\nAfter graduating from the University of Georgia with a degree in Environmental Science, Alex spent several years working for the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, focusing on conservation efforts and community outreach programs. Her passion for the environment eventually led her to start her own sustainable gardening business, which she runs from her cozy home in Atlanta's Inman Park neighborhood.\\n\\nAlex is a divorced mother of two children, ages 12 and 15, who are the center of her universe. Her children's father, a musician, lives in the same city, and they share joint custody, ensuring the kids spend quality time with both parents.
