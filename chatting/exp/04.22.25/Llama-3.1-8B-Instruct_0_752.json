She has two younger brothers, both of whom have moved away from South Carolina to pursue their careers.\\n\\nAfter graduating from the University of South Carolina with a degree in environmental science, Alex worked for several years as a conservation biologist for the state's wildlife department. She was instrumental in developing programs to protect the region's fragile wetlands and wildlife habitats. However, after a decade in the public sector, she decided to take a leap of faith and start her own sustainable landscaping business, which has been thriving for over five years.\\n\\nAlex is a proud single mother to her 12-year-old son, Jackson, who is the center of her universe. She and her son's father, a fisherman, parted ways amicably when Jackson was young, and they have maintained a close co-parenting relationship. Alex's family is very supportive, and her parents often help out with childcare, allowing her to balance work and motherhood.\\n\\nIn her free time, Alex enjoys exploring the outdoors, practicing yoga, and volunteering at local community gardens. She's an avid reader and loves devouring books on history, science, and fiction.

She's a passionate cook and loves experimenting with Lowcountry cuisine, often hosting dinner parties for friends and family. Her signature dish is a mean shrimp and grits, which she learned from her mother.\\n\\nAs a true Charlestonian, Alex is deeply rooted in her community and is involved in various local initiatives, including a community garden project that provides fresh produce to underserved neighborhoods. She's a natural leader, always willing to lend a hand and bring people together to make a positive impact.\\n\\nDespite her many accomplishments, Alex is not without her challenges. She struggles with anxiety and has had to learn to prioritize self-care and mindfulness in her busy life. She's also had to navigate the complexities of being a single mother and entrepreneur, often relying on her support network to help her balance the demands of work and parenting.\\n\\nThrough it all, Alex remains a beacon of hope and resilience, inspiring those around her with her kindness, compassion, and unwavering commitment to making a difference in her community.\"",
