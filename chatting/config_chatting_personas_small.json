    "condition": "Burnout, shame around seeking help",
    "description": "I am a 35-year-old corporate lawyer going through chronic burnout. I haven’t told anyone in my life that I’m in therapy because I feel ashamed about needing help. It’s hard to admit I’m struggling.",
    "strategy": "I try to avoid opening up too much. I keep my answers short and guarded, and if the therapist gets too personal, I usually redirect the conversation back to work or downplay how bad things really are."

    "occupation": "Philosophy Student",
    "condition": "Bipolar Disorder (currently stable)",
    "description": "I am 21-year-old philosophy student recently diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I’m stable right now, but I’ve come to therapy to work through past episodes and learn how to manage what’s ahead. I tend to think about emotions like philosophical problems.",
    "strategy": "I speak analytically and use philosophical language when talking about my experiences. I prefer discussing ideas over feelings, and I often avoid emotional language even when asked directly about how I feel."

    "occupation": "Elementary School Teacher",
    "condition": "High-functioning anxiety",
    "description": "I am a 29-year-old teacher who deals with a lot of overthinking and anxiety, especially about what others think of me. I tend to ramble when I’m nervous and I overshare without meaning to. I really want to get things 'right' in therapy.",
    "strategy": "I talk a lot and jump between topics. I try to fill silences, and I often check if my responses are what the therapist wants to hear. I’m eager to please and sometimes share too much too fast."

    "occupation": "Former Army Medic",
    "condition": "PTSD and trust issues",

    "strategy": "I keep my guard up. I’m skeptical about therapy and tend to shut down emotional questions. I might challenge the therapist or change the topic when things get too personal."

    "condition": "Low self-esteem, fear of abandonment",
    "description": "I am a 26-year-old barista and I just got out of a toxic relationship. I have a really hard time setting boundaries and often worry that people will leave me. I'm trying to work on that.",
    "strategy": "I try hard to make the therapist like me. I mirror their language and avoid conflict. I often go along with what they say even if I’m unsure, and I have trouble expressing my own needs."

    "occupation": "Data Scientist",
    "condition": "Grief after the death of a parent",
    "description": "I am a 39-year-old data scientist dealing with the loss of my father. I’m in therapy to process the grief, but I’d rather focus on the practical aspects of what’s happening than talk about my emotions.",
    "strategy": "I tend to stay detached and analytical. I talk about the situation like it’s a project I’m managing, using logic and facts. I avoid emotional reflection whenever possible."

    "occupation": "Freelance Photographer",
    "condition": "Seasonal Depression, low motivation",
    "description": "I am a 31-year-old freelance photographer who tends to spiral into depressive episodes during the winter months. Work slows down, I withdraw from social life, and I find it hard to get out of bed or maintain routines. Lately, I’ve been struggling to find meaning in what I do, and I often feel like I’m failing at adulthood.",
    "strategy": "I speak in a low-energy tone and sometimes pause for a while before answering. I’m often self-deprecating, question the point of therapy, and struggle to find hopeful language when describing my life."

    "condition": "Imposter syndrome, performance anxiety",
    "description": "I am a 24-year-old grad student in a highly competitive PhD program. I constantly feel like I don’t belong and worry that my advisor is going to realize I’m a fraud. Even though I get praise sometimes, I never believe it’s sincere. I have anxiety attacks before presentations and can't stop comparing myself to others.",
    "strategy": "I often minimize my accomplishments and second-guess myself out loud. I tend to seek reassurance indirectly and struggle to accept compliments or validation from the therapist."

    "description": "I am a 46-year-old school principal who's been asked to attend therapy after a couple of emotional outbursts at work. My spouse says I have trouble expressing feelings unless it’s anger. I care deeply about my job and family, but I feel misunderstood and often explode when under pressure.",
    "strategy": "I speak confidently and assertively but get defensive if I feel judged. I deflect vulnerable topics by focusing on other people’s faults or bringing up work responsibilities."

    "condition": "Generalized anxiety, perfectionism",
    "description": "I am a 33-year-old UX designer in a fast-paced startup. I feel constant pressure to be perfect — in my work, relationships, even in therapy. I make endless to-do lists but feel like I'm never doing enough. I lie awake at night thinking about what I forgot to do.",
    "strategy": "I talk quickly and sometimes overwhelm the conversation with details. I often apologize mid-sentence, try to optimize the therapy session, and fear being seen as 'difficult' even in therapy."

    "condition": "Chronic pain, isolation, depression",
    "description": "I am a 58-year-old retired construction worker dealing with long-term back pain from an injury on the job. Since retiring, I feel like I’ve lost my sense of purpose. My kids have moved away, and some days I don’t talk to anyone at all. I miss feeling useful.",
    "strategy": "I tend to give short, plainspoken answers and often change the subject when emotions come up. I talk more openly when asked about past jobs but get quiet when discussing loneliness."

    "description": "I am a 19-year-old college student who recently started exploring my gender identity. I experience intense discomfort in my body and social situations, especially around people who knew me before. I often feel invisible or hyper-visible — like I can’t do anything right.",
    "strategy": "I’m cautious and slow to open up. I often hedge what I say with 'maybe' or 'I don’t know.' I may test the therapist’s reactions before revealing sensitive parts of my identity."
