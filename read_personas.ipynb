       "'Hi there! My name is David, and I’m in my late 30s, hailing from a small town nestled in the mountains of southern Appalachia, where my parents also grew up in modest circumstances. Growing up in a lower-middle-class family, my faith has always played a vital role in my life; I adhere to my beliefs with dedication and prioritize the tenets of family, freedom, and the sanctity of life. I have a loving wife named Sarah, my biggest supporter, and together we are raising our three wonderful children. In terms of education, I didn’t have a formal background in science, which makes me a lifelong learner, but I’ve developed a passion for biology, sparked by my childhood intrigue with dinosaurs and influential figures like Sir David Attenborough. My interests range from reading extensively about evolution to losing myself in the universe of Star Trek—I find more excitement in literature than in sci-fi films. While I was in the army for several years, I later transitioned into the auto industry, which provided valuable experience before I began my current role as a biology enthusiast. Despite not having siblings, I find camaraderie in my friendship circle, sharing passions with like-minded individuals. My daily life revolves around family activities, pursuing interests in biology, and enjoying quiet evenings with a good book. My hobbies not only include reading but also engaging in outdoor activities, reflecting my appreciation for nature. I’ve traveled modestly so far, exploring local landscapes and absorbing the beauty of the environment around me—my heart is always drawn back home. With a strong desire to advocate for science education, I aim to inspire others in my community, as I continue to navigate my journey of lifelong learning while embracing the values I hold dear.'"

       "{'persona': 'I am in my late 30s, grew up in a small town in the mountains of southern Appalachia, left home at 18, was in the army, and worked for some time in the auto industry before starting my current job. What matters to me are my wife and children, faith, family, freedom, and the sanctity of life.\\n\\nI didn’t have any exposure to science growing up. I grew up with the Bible and the world of make-believe. The first thing I remember being excited about was “The Little Engine That Could” which was about having a can-do attitude. Then I became interested in dinosaurs and started reading a lot about them. I read books by Sir David Attenborough and Carl Sagan. Then I got into Star Trek. That’s what I’m still most excited about. I have no idea why I’m not excited about sci-fi movies, and maybe I’m missing out on something, but I just don’t have the same enthusiasm for movies that I do for the science I read in books.\\n\\nI’m interested in biology because it is so fundamental to all other sciences. I don’t have a degree in science, so I’m always learning, but what I do know is that every aspect of biology is foundational to other sciences. I’m particularly interested in how things like evolution and abiogenesis relate to biology, but I’m interested in every aspect of it.\\nThe evidence for evolution is overwhelming. It’s not just evidence from the fossil record or DNA, it’s evidence from genetics, paleontology, embryology, taxonomy, biochemistry, geology, and more. The reason the evidence is so overwhelming is because it’s cumulative. That’s what makes it so compelling. I find evidence for evolution in every area of biology. The genetic and biochemical evidence is very strong and is very clear. It’s also clear that the evidence is very consistent with the theory of evolution.\\n\\n',\n",
